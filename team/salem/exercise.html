			<li>Type: git remote add upstream “url of the repo you forked from”</li>
			<ul>
				<li>This will add the original repo to your list of upstreams you may or may not have.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Type: git pull upstream master</li>
			<ul>
				<li>This will fetch the original repository and add to your local deposit.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Type: git push origin master</li>
			<ul>
				<li>This will add the deposit on your local to the repository that is located on your github account.</li>
			</ul>
