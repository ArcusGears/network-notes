    <h1>8.2.2 Notes</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>1961 to 1972</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Leonard Kleinrock</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The first published work on packet-switching techniques</li>
					<li>He used queuing theory to demonstrated the effectiveness of the packet-switching approach for bursty traffic sources.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Paul Baran</li>
				<ul>
					<li>worked at the National Physical Laboratory in England</li>
					<li>investigated the use of packet switching for secure voice over military networks</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		<li>1972 to 1980</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Norman Abramson</li>
				<ul>
					<li>developing ALOHAnet, a packet-based radio network that allowed multiple remote sites on the Hawaiian Islands to communicate with each other</li>
					<li>The program was the first multiple-access protocol, allowing geographically distributed users to share a single broadcast communication medium (a radio frequency).</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn</li>
				<ul>
					<li>They worked on interconnecting networks (under the sponsorship of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)), in essence creating a network of networks</li>
					<li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf">About Vinton Cerf</a></li>
					<li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn">About Rovert Kahn</a></li>
				</ul>
			<li>Metcalfe and Boggs</li>
			<ul>
				<li>built on Abramson’s multiple-access protocol work when they developed the Ethernet protocol</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>1980 to 1990</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Minitel project</li>
			<ul>
				<li>In the early 1980s the French launched the Minitel project.</li>
				<li>Used consisted of a public packet-switched network, Minitel servers, and inexpensive terminals with built-in low-speed modems.</li>
				<li>Succeeded in 1984</li>
				<li>Included free sites—such as a telephone directory site—as well as private sites, which collected a usage-based fee from each user.</li>
				<li>Was in a large proportion of French homes 10 years before most Americans had ever heard of the Internet.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>1990s</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Tim Berners-Lee</li>
				<li>Worked at CERN</li>
				<li>developed initial versions of HTML, HTTP, a Web server, and a browser based on ideas originating in earlier work on hypertext from</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Vannevar Bush (1940s)</li>
				<li>Ted Nelson (1960s)</li>

		<ul>
			<li><h2>P2P(Peer To Peer)</h2></li>
			<li>future challenges:
			<ul>
				<li>ISP Friendly: If switching from downstream to upstream will change from server to redsidential ISP, so there will be significant pressure on ISPs.</li>
				<li>Security: because P2P is so open and highly distributed, so securing it will be difficult.</li>
				<li>Incentives: volunteers supply the bandwidth, storyage, and computation resources to application, so their might be a challenge in incentive design.</li>
			</ul>


			<li><h2>process</h2></li>
			<ul>
				<li>can be thought of as a program that is running within an end system.</li>
			</ul>


			<li><h2>client and server</h2></li>
			<ul>
				<li>browser is a client process.</li>
				<li>Web server is a server process.</li>
			</ul>


			<li><h2>socket</h2></li>
			<ul>
				<li>When a process wants to send a message to antoher process on another host, it shoves the message out its socket.</li>
			</ul>


			<li><h2>IP address</h2></li>
			<ul>
				<li>the host identified</li>
			</ul>


			<li><h2>Services along four dimensions:</h2></li>
			<ul>


			<li><h3>Reliable Data Transfer</h3></li>
			<ul>
				<li>a transport-layer protocol can potentially provide to an application is process-to-process reliable data transfer.  However, there is a loss-tolerant applications that may not arrive but that is acceptable.</li>
			</ul>


			<li><h2>Throughput</h2></li>
			<ul>
				<li>rate at which the sending process can deliver bits to the receiving process.</li>
			</ul>


			<li><h2>Timing</h2></li>
			<ul>
				<li>a transport-layer protocol can guarantee that time contraints on data delivery will be achieved.</li>
			</ul>


			<li><h2>Security</h2></li>
			<ul>
				<li>A transport protocol can provide an application with one or more security services.</li>
			</ul>
