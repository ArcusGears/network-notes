        <h3>Questions on Reading</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>What is the difference between a DDoS attack and a DoS attack, and why is it harder to protect against?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The source of the attack is distributed in a DDoS, so instead of blocking just one source, you must block multiple, which is much harder to do. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>What year (give or take 6 years) was the first packet switch installed?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1969</li>
                </ul>
            <li>What is the equation for the end-to-end Delay for one packet and what does each constant/variable stand for?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>a.	dend-to-end=N(L/R)</li>
                    <li>b.	N is the number of links. L is the number of bits and R is the transmission rate (bits/second)</li>
                </ul>
            <li>3.	What are 4 of the 5 layers of a 5 layer internet protocol stack?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Application, Transport, Network, Link, Physical</li>
                </ul>
            <li>What is the main difference between a client-server architecture and a p2p architecture?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A client-server has a server that connects between the clients. In a p2p architecture, the clients connect to each other directly. Those clients are called peers.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>What is the main purpose of cookies?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>To allow sites to keep track of its users</li>
                </ul>
            <li>What protocols do HTTP and SMTP use? How are they different?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>a.	HTTP uses a pull protocol and SMTP uses push protocol.</li>
                    <li>b.	A push protocol will push the information to the receiver, while a pull protocol will load the information on a web server and the client can pull the information at any time. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Describe the rarest first technique.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>When torrenting, out of the chunks you don't have, you request to rarest (least amount of uploaders have the chunk) chunk first.</li>
                </ul>

        </ol>

        <h3>NAT Wireshark Lab</h3>
        <p>NAT or Network Address translation is a way of dealing with the limited IPv4 addresses. A device with NAT will allow multiple devices to connect to it and that device itself will connect to the WAN by taking the requests of the other devices and using it’s own IP address to relay the request to the desired destination. Wireshark will help us understand how this is happening a little better. </p> 
        <p>This lab requires capturing packets from two locations (a NAT device and a computer), so they just gave us a sample capture to work with. The example uses a home network connecting to Google. The home network router provides a NAT service.</p>

        <p>Questions 1-5 use the file NAT_home_side while 6-10 use NAT_ISP_side</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the IP address of the client?</li>
            <ul><li>192.168.1.100</li></ul>
          <li>This one is only directions. It tells us to type in “http&&ip.addr==64.233.169.104” without the quotation marks in the filter to only the communication with the main Google server.</li>
          <li>Consider now the HTTP GET sent from the client to the Google server (whose IP address is IP address 64.233.169.104) at time 7.109267. What are the source and destination IP addresses and TCP source and destination ports on the IP datagram carrying this HTTP GET?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Source/destination IP: 192.168.1.100 / 64.233.169.104</li>
                <li>TCP source/destination ports: 4335 / 80</li>
            </ul>
          <li>At what time is the corresponding 200 OK HTTP message received from the GOogle server? What are the source and destination IP addresses and TCP source and destination ports on the IP datagram carrying this HTTP 200 OK message?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Time: 7.158797</li>
                <li>Source/destination IP: 64.233.169.104 / 192.168.1.100</li>
                <li>TCP source/destination ports: 80 / 4335</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Find the SYN/ACK handshake that corresponds with the previous request. Type in tcp in to the filter. There are three tcp before the GET HTTP. What is the time, source/destination IP/Ports?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It is at time 7.075657</li>
                <li>Source/destination IP: 192.168.1.100 / 64.233.169.104</li>
                <li>TCP source/destination ports: 4335 / 80</li>
                <li>Time for the responding ack is 7.108986 with the opposite IP and ports</li>
            </ul>
          <li>In the NAT_ISP_sidetrace file, find the HTTP GET message was sent from the client to the Google server at time 7.109267 (where t=7.109267 is time at which this was sent as recorded in the NAT_home_side trace file). At what time does this message appear in the NAT_ISP_sidetrace file?  What are the source and destination IP addresses and TCP source and destination ports on the IP datagram carrying this HTTP GET (as recording in the NAT_ISP_side trace file)?  Which of these fields are the same, and which are different, than in your answer to question 3 above?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Time: 6.069168</li>
                <li>Source IP:71.192.34.104 Port: 4335</li>
                <li>Destination IP: 64.233.169.104 Port 80</li>
                <li>The IP address for the source is different</li>
            </ul>
          <li>	The IP address for the source is different. 
Are any fields in the HTTP GET message changed? Which of the following fields in the IP datagram carrying the HTTP GET are changed: Version, Header Length, Flags, Checksum.  If any of these fields have changed, give a reason (in one sentence) stating why this field needed to change.</li>
            <ul><li>The checksum changed, because the checksum has part of it based off the IP address, and since that changed, the checksum changed too.</li></ul>
          <li>In the NAT_ISP_sidetrace file, at what time is the first 200 OK HTTP message received from the Google server?  What are the source and destination IP addresses and TCP source and destination ports on the IP datagram carrying this HTTP 200 OK message? Which of these fields are the same, and which are different than your answer to question 4 above?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Time: 6.308118</li>
                <li>Source IP: 64.233.169.104 Port: 80</li>
                <li>Destination IP: IP:71.192.34.104 Port: 4335</li>
                <li>The destination IP is different than in question 4</li>
            </ul>
          <li>In the NAT_ISP_sidetracefile, at what time were the client-to-server TCP SYN segment and the server-to-client TCP ACK segment corresponding to the segments in question 5 above captured?What are the source and destination IP addresses and source and destination ports for these two segments?Which of these fields are the same, and which are different than your answer to question 5 above?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Time: SYN: 6.035475 ACK: 6.06775</li>
                <li>Source: SYN IP: 71.192.34.104 Port: 4335 ACK IP: 64.233.169.104 Port: 80Destination: SYN IP: 64.233.169.104 Port: 80 ACK IP: 71.192.34.104 Port: 4335 </li>
                <li>Destination: SYN IP: 64.233.169.104 Port: 80 ACK IP: 71.192.34.104 Port: 4335 </li>
                <li>The port numbers are the same, but the SYN source IP and the ACK destination IP are different.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
