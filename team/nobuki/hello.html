    <p>
        I really like orcas and Pancheros. I love romantic walks on the beach and spontaneous adventures. I'm interested in females below the age of 70.
        DM me if you want to learn more ;)

    <ul>
        <li>malware: a broad term for malicious things that can enter and infect a device</li>
        <li>botnet: a network of thousands of similarly compromised devices</li>
        <li>self-replicating: once it infects one host, from that host it seeks entry into other hosts over the Internet</li>
        <li>Viruses: malware that require some form of user interaction to infect the userâ€™s device</li>
        <li>Worms are malware that can enter a device without any explicit user interaction</li>
        
        <li>DoS attacks, or Denial-of-Service attacks do exactly what the name implies. It renders a network, host, or other piece
of infrastructure unusable by legitimate users</li>
        <li>There are three main types of dos attacks</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Vulnerablility attacks: well-crafted messages are sent to a vulnerable application or operating system. The packets sent may stop or crash a service or host.</li>
            <li>Bandwidth flooding: sends so many packets to a host that it clogs the access link, preventing legitimate packets from reaching the server </li>
            <li>Connection flooding: similar to dwidth flooding, except it uses TCP connections to prevent other connections </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bandwidth flooding in more detail</li>
        <ul>
            <li>if an attacker sends access rate of  R bps, it will cause damage</li>
            <li>if the attacker has one source of attack, it is easier for the routers to block it off, but if there are multiple sources, it is much harder</li>
            <li>if there are multiple sources, it is called a DDoS(distributed denial of service)</li>
            <li>DDoS can use infected botnets for the attacks</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Packet sniffer: a passive reciever that is placed near a wireless transmitter that takes in and records all the packets that pass by</li>
        <ul>
            <li>wired or LAN networks can also be sniffed</li>
            <li>packet sniffers are hard to detect because they are passive.</li>
            <li>the best defense is cryptography</li>  
        </ul> 
        <li>IP spoofing: giving a false source to hide the attacker as another user</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Network Applications</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>It is important to write programs that run on different types of end systems.</li>
        <li>When writing the code, it should be written in a way that can be run on multiple end systems (written in java, C, or python)</li>
        <li>You don't need to write code that runs in network core devices like routers, or linked layer switches, because you can't</li>
        <li>Application Architecture</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-Server Architecture: there is an always-oh host called a server. that server services requests from many other hosts called clients</li>
            <li>two clients don't directly communicate with each other</li>
            <li>the server has an IP address</li>
            <li>Client can always contact the server by sending packets to the IP address</li>
            <li>Data Center: a large virtual server housing a large number of hosts. It is used if only one server is handling all the requests and it is being overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>Peer-to-peer or P2P doesnt rely on dedicated servers</li>
            <li>p2p connects hosts directly called peers</li>
            <li>peers are personal devices</li>
            <li>self scalability: peers create the workload, but also take the workload.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
