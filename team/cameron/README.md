Hi there!

In order to view the notes I have created, run `python2 serve.py`. This starts
a simple web server at `localhost:8080` serving the contents of `www`, the
source of which is generated by Jekyll from `src`.

If you need to, supply a different host with `--host`, and/or a different port
with `--port`.
