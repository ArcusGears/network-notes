                    Q:  What are the two overlaying protocols that control the sending and receiving
                    of information on the internet?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="question2">
                <p>
                    Q:  What are distributed applications and why are they considered distributed?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  Distrubted applications are applications which run on end systems.  That is
                    to say, these applications run on separate hosts and use the internet to send and
                    receive data with applications running on other remote host machines.  They are
                    therefore considered distributed because they communicate across a network as opposed
                    to internally with applications on the same machine.

                    Q:  In our context, what is a protocol?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between
                    two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission
                    and/or receipt of a message or other event.

                    Q:  Name three physical mediums for transmitting data on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  Possibilities: Fiber Optic Cable, Coaxial Cable, Twisted Pair Copper Wire (Insulated
                    and Unshielded), Satellite Radio Channels, Terrestrial Radio Channels.

                <p>
                    Q:  What is meant by the phrase "A Network of Networks"?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  This is part of our theme of layers of abstraction.  There are routers and communication
                    links which span the entire globe, and this in itself is a network.  However, there is not
                    one single ISP which manages this entire global network.  Instead, ISPs charge and segment
                    networks on an individual basis, or sometimes in small chunks of routers.  These are each networks
                    as well, and we therefore call this system a network of interconnected networks.

                    Q:  What are the different types of delay at a node in a packet-switch network?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  A node in a packet-switch network may suffer from processing, queuing, transmission, and
                    propogation delays together make up what is called total nodal delay.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="question7">
                <p>
                    Q:  For what kind of application is it critical to have low delay, and for what kind is it not
                    ciritical for low delays, but desirable for high throughput?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  Internet telephony, video calling, and gaming requires low delay because the real-time information
                    is critical.  For file transfering it is not critical to have low delays, but it is desirable
                    to have high throughput to get the entire file quickly.

                <p>
                    Q:  Please name the two network application architectures and give one advantage of each.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  The two architectures are client-server and peer to peer or P2P.  Client-server models
                    have many advantages, the primary one being a simple structure which allows end users to
                    access the entire network by connecting solely to the central server, providing ease of access
                    as well as relative security.  Peer to peer has the advantage of a direct connection to other
                    users, so that the network connections are not dependent on a single point of failure.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Kleinrock is an important American computer 
            scientist who, among other things, worked very closely with the development of the first 
            pieces of hardware that comprised the internet in the early days.&nbsp;&nbsp;He graduated from 
            MIT with a doctorate in computer science in 1963, and then joined the faculty at UCLA where he 
            remains today.<br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleirock's most recognized and significant work was 
            done on queuing theory, which is instrumental to packet switching and in turn the concepts of 
            computer networks that we are learning about in this class.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his PhD research 
            Kleinrock describes his work as being to, "establish a mathematical theory of packet networks...".
            &nbsp;&nbsp;This work would become critical not only in his work at MIT on the first ARPANET 
            message, but also for the operation of the world wide web today.<br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw in the movie "Lo and Behold" the machine that 
            Charley Kline used to send the first message on October 29th, 1969.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleinrock oversaw this 
            operation and after the first system crash the system was recovered and a month later the first 
            permanent ARPANET link between Stanford and MIT was established.<br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Kleinrock has since made a number of contributions 
            to the bureaucratic acceptance of the use of the internet for personal reasons, and was inducted into 
            the Internet Hall of Fame in 2012, among receiving a number of other nationally significant awards.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;These include the National Medal of Science, which he received in 2008, and an induction into IEEE-Eta 
            Kappa Nu in 2011.  This man has lead an incredible life, and his work has undoubtedly help shape the 
            landscape of modern society.

        <p>The lab instructions simply ask us to answer the questions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Q: What is the IP address and TCP port number used by your client computer to transfer the
                    file to gaia.cs.umass.edu?  What is the IP address and port number used by gaia.cs.umass.edu to 
                    receive the file?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: The source computer's IP address is 10.128.6.4 and the TCP port number is 4444.  The destination 
                    computer's IP address is 128.119.245.12 and it uses port 80.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Q:  What is the sequence number of the TCP SYN segment that is used to initiate the TCP connection 
                    between the client computer and gaia.cs.umass.edu?  What is it in the segment that identifies the 
                    segment as a SYN segment?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  The sequence number of the TCP SYN segment is the value used to intitiate the TCP handshake between 
                    the two computers.  The value is 0.  The SYN flag has a value of 1 which is what denotes that this 
                    is a SYN segment.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Q:  What is the sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu to the client computer 
                    in reply to the SYN?  What is the value of the ACKnowledgement field in the SYNACK segment?  How did 
                    gaia.cs.umass.edu determine that value? What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a 
                    SYNACK segment?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  The sequence number in reply to the SYN is 0.  The ACK value in the SYNACK segment is 1.  The 
                    gaia.cs.umass.edu computer adds 1 to the initial field in the SYNACK segment from the client computer 
                    to achieve the SYNACK segment flags.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Q:  What is the sequence number of the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST command?  Note that 
                    in order to find the POST command, you'll need to dig into the packet content field at the bottom 
                    of the Wireshark window, looking for a segment with a "POST" within its DATA field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  The sequence number of the segment containing the HTTP POST command is 1.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Q:   Consider the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST as the first
                    segment in the TCP connection. What are the sequence numbers of the first six
                    segments in the TCP connection (including the segment containing the HTTP
                    POST)? At what time was each segment sent? When was the ACK for each
                    segment received? Given the difference between when each TCP segment was
                    sent, and when its acknowledgement was received, what is the RTT value for each
                    of the six segments? What is the EstimatedRTT value (see page 237 in text)
                    after the receipt of each ACK? Assume that the value of the EstimatedRTT is
                    equal to the measured RTT for the first segment, and then is computed using the
                    EstimatedRTT equation on page 249 for all subsequent segments.<br/><br/>
                    Note: Wireshark has a nice feature that allows you to plot the RTT for
                    each of the TCP segments sent. Select a TCP segment in the “listing of
                    captured packets” window that is being sent from the client to the
                    gaia.cs.umass.edu server. Then select: Statistics->TCP Stream Graph-
                    >Round Trip Time Graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  The HTTP POST segment is the first segment.  The sequence numbers for segments 1-6 are 
                    1, 566, 2026, 3486, 4946, and 6406, respectively.  The sending and receiving times can be listed as 
                    follows:
