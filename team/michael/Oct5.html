<h2>Client-Server Architecture</h2>
    <p>
     A server is a computer that <i>serves</i> items to other computers. The server is called the <i>host</i>, and the other computers requesting items from the server are called <i>clients.</i> Applications with a client-server architecture include: 
    </p>
<ul>
<li>Web</li>
<li>FTP</li>
<li>Telnet</li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<p>
A data center is a collection of servers. Large internet service providers like google have many datacenters numbering in the hundreds of thousands of servers. 
</p>

<h2>P2P Architecture</h2>
<p>In P2P there is no need 
for servers. applications exploit communication between two connected hosts called <i>peers</i>. Becuase these hosts communicate directly, it is called a  <i>peer-to-peer</i> connection. P2P applications include
<ul>
<li>File Sharing (Torrents)</li>
<li>Download acceleration</li>
<li>Telephony(Skype)</li>
<li>IPTV(Internet Protocol Television)</li>
</ul>
