       <u> Donald Davies</u>
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Pioneer of Packet Switching
    </h2>
    <div style="text-align:left;">
  <p>
    Core to the inner workings of the Internet is the concept of packet switching; the versatility and efficiency of such a system, as opposed to circuit switching, makes such a massively complex network possible. This concept was not birthed wholly in the mind of one, and in fact, many researchers working just before the advent of the Internet had similar ideas. Among the most notable of these researchers was Donald Davies, a Welsh computer scientist who went on to coin the term &#34;packet switching&#34; itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Davies was born in Treorchy, a small village in the Rhonnda Valley of Wales, in June of 1924. Despite a modest upbringing, he went on to attend the Imperial College in London where he received subsequent BSc&#39;s in Physics and Mathematics, both times receiving the highest honors. During his last year of schooling, Davies attended a lecture by John Womersley, head of the mathematics division at NPL (National Physical Laboratory), where he first learned of the facility&#39;s emergent computer research. After graduating, Davies NPL&#39;s research team developing the ACE computer, a project led by Alan Turing. There was little comradery between Turing and Davies. The young researcher, hoping to achieve Turing&#39;s respect, elucidated several mathematical errors in the paper proposing the &#34;universal Turing machine.&#34; &#34;I went along to tell him and I was rather cock-a-hoop ...  he was very annoyed,&#34; Davies later recounted.
  </p>
  <img src="davies_donald.jpg" align="right" style="padding:20px;">
  <p>
    The ACE project proved overambitious, but Turing departed, Davies stayed on to lead the development of a smaller device, the Pilot ACE, known primarily as the first computer in London and the basis of several successful commercial spin-offs.. Davies would only invest more time into the development of computer software, developing programs for simulating road traffic and translating technical Russian to English. He advanced quickly through the ranks of NPL, becoming the technical manager of their Advanced Computer techniques division in 1963 and subsequently leading the entirety of the computing division in 1966.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  After his promotion, Davies steered the department towards a problem he&#39;d witnessed during a visit to MIT  in 1965. It was here that one of the first computer networks had been instituted, based on circuit switching technology; students could sit at a personal terminal with a direct connection to the mainframe, and reserve a fixed percentage of networks bandwidth to issue commands. Because the students spent so much of their time thinking, and so little time actually inputting commands, much of the bandwidth went unutilized. Davies sought to rectify this by designing a system around the bursty nature of human communication, reducing the multiple parallel connections to a single, shared link and splitting the messages sent through it into discrete packets. He called this system &#34;packet switching,&#34; and lofty plans to incorporate it into the national telecommunications infrastructure. Despite successful trials in an experimental network at NPL, the British government resisted Davie&#39;s ambitions for many years. Before any further progress was made in the UK, DARPA researcher Larry Roberts decided to incorporate Davie&#39;s research into his own fledgling network, Arpanet, a prototype that paved the way for the future development of the internet.
</p>
<p>
  After relinquishing his position at NPL in 1979, Donald Davies continued private research in the field of communications, focusing the bulk of his efforts in network security. After his retirement in 1984, he was known for some time as a great authority on wartime cryptography, a natural consequence of his knowledge of computer history and experience in security.
</p>
<p>
Davies passed away in May of 2000, and was survived by his wife of 45 years, Diane Burton, and their three children.

      This past Summer, I worked on a project for the Physics department 
      involving audio phased arrays, a technology that requires extremely 
      precise synchronization between multiple devices. Researching solutions, 
      I discovered that there are inherent issues with packet based networking 
      that make precise synchronization impossible. These problems are explainable 
    <img src="NTP-Algorithm.png" align="right" style="padding:20px;">
      using concepts in section 1.3 of the textbook. <br><br>

      For the sake of this exercise, Processing, queuing, transmission, and propagation
      delays will be labeled P, Q, T, and L, respectively. To make the exercise less
      infuriating, you may use D as the sum of these delays. To label delays pertaining
      to an outgoing message, type D1 and to label incoming delays, type D2. <br><br><br>

		<u>WiFi Direct Tutorial</u>
	</h2>
	<p>
		For this tutorial, I&#39;ll be walking you through a brief look at the foundation of Android WiFi Direct Application 
		layer protocol. This is part of a Networking class, not an Android Programming class, so I&#39;ll provide the basic framework
		for the app. You may be prompted to provide a couple of examples of code to finish the app. Here are a couple of basic Android 
		programming terms that will be helpful to know:
<br><br>
Activity: Each new, interactable screen a user sees has an underlying &#34;activity.&#34; Code written in activities dictate each discrete action a user can make.
<br><br>
Broadcast Receiver: A service that listens over the app&#39;s WiFi Direct channel and sends commands to an underlying activity after certain events occur.
<br><br>
You&#39;ll be looking through a series of in app steps that will end in a functional WiFi Direct app. This app will send basic messages, 
but can be easily modified for sharing other types of data.
    </p>
	<ol>
			
			<li>In the provided folder, navigate to app/src/main/java/com/example/simplewifidirectchat. This contains all of the core java files for the program. MainActivity.java contains the code for the main screen of the app. The OnCreate method is executed when the app starts up. There are three core Objects and one core Class. You&#39;ll see the former of these initiated here: the WiFi P2P Manager, the Channel, and the Broadcast Receiver. You can look at the core of the Broadcast Receiver class if you&#39;d like; it&#39;s an always-on service that listens for specific state changes. We&#39;ll now follow the path around the app.</li>
			<br>
			<li>The app has an options menu that initiates the connection. Scroll down to the bottom of the class, and look for the OnOptionItemSelected method. When a certain icon is chosen (the only icon in this case), a linked activity that searched for nearby devices will be launched. After searching, you&#39;ll be able to choose from a selection. The chosen device info is forwarded to the connectDevice method.</li>
			<br>
			<li>This method extracts some important information from the raw device data. We&#39;ll take the MAC address and some configuration info and send them to a series of client connect threads.</li>
			<br>
			<li>The client will connect through ConnectedThread. A new socket is created, with pointers to the Server&#39;s MAC address and the port to connect to. Specify this port here, after the comma following the address in the socket.connect method. You may use any unused port. Keep in mind you&#39;ll be initiating this port on the Server thread, so remember this number.</li>
			<br>
			<li>The Server initiates a similar thread, but only needs to specify a port number and wait for the client to connect. In mConnectServerStream, there is a declaration for a new ServerSocket object. In the empty parentheses after ServerSocket, type the same port you specified for the client.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Your devices should be able to connect now. Both the Client and Server threads are still running. When both of them started, they set up input and output streams. Each has an underlying buffer of an array of bytes. Within the declaration, specify the size of this buffer. A large buffer size will reduce the probability of packet loss, but a smaller buffer size will reduce queueing delay (A power of two is pretty standard).</li>

  <h2>
    <u>UDP Highlights</u>
  </h2>
  <p>Although UDP is less reliable than TCP, it still finds use in many applications where its flexibility, speed, and lightweight nature outweigh its inherent flaws.  
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>UDP is no frills, and as such, there is no throttling of its handled messages. TCP attempts to handle congestion through the restriction of bandwidth, but any messages sent through UDP will be immediately handled. UDP can also send messages, as needed, in immediate succesion, where its counterpart would require acquisition confirmation after each message before sending the next.
    </li>
    <li>UDP establishes no consistent connection, and so no tracking of connection state is required. This necessity limits the number of possilbe concurrent TCP connections, a weakness UDP does not share.
    </li>
    <li>UDP uses significantly less header space than TCP (8 to 20 bytes, respectively).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br><br>
  <p>Applications that often utilize UDP include media streaming services, routing protocol, network management, and DNS.
  <p>

  <h3><u>UDP Checksum</u></h3>
  <p>Because UDP operates independently from lower level protocols, it cannot guarantee that any of these will provide their own error detection. UDP provides its own in the form of an 8 byte checksum. At the message source, three random 16 bit numbers are added; the 1's complement* of this sum is calculated, and then appended to the segment. When the message arrives at its destination, the receiver sums all of the numbers. If this yields a new 16 bit number of all 1's, the checksum is successful.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h4><em>Thoughts: Liabilities?</em></h4>
  <p>It seems as if it might be possible that the checksum would yield a false positive under some, rare circumstances. What if an error causes differences in both the sum and the complement, such that said errors cancel? What if the bits in the segment sections surrounding the checksum have been altered, while the checksum itself remains intact?</p>
  <br>
  <h5 style="text-align:right;"><em>*The 1's compliment of a binary number is simply a conversion of all of its 1's to 0's, and vice versa.</em></h6>

  <h2>
    <u>TCP - Timeout Calculation</u>
  </h2>
  <p>TCP is, at its heart, an rdt protocol, and so it has a set 'time-out' period after which it will retransmit the previous segment. The time chosen for this interval is not immediately obvious; it clearly must be greater than the expected round trip time of the segment, but how does TCP calculate this, and how long beyond this time should TCP idle? THere must be some compromise, as too little time may cause recurring retransmissions while confirmation is in transit, but too much time will stall transmission longer than necessary and reduce throughput.<br><br>
  TCP has a series of algorithms to achieve this compromise. The first is a weighted function utilized to calculate the estimated RTT, while the second calculates the average deviation of the RTT; the timeout duration is acquired through the repeated iteration of these functions.<br><br>
  These algorithms are as follows:<br><br>
  <u>RTT Algorithm</u><br>
  <span style="font-size: 18px">&epsilon;<sub>n</sub> = (1 - &alpha;)&epsilon;<sub>n-1</sub> + &alpha;s<sub>n</sub></span>
  <br><br>
  <u>Deviation Algorithm</u><br>
  <span style="font-size: 18px">&sigma;<sub>n</sub> = (1 - &beta;)&sigma;<sub>n-1</sub> + &beta;|s<sub>n</sub> - &epsilon;<sub>n</sub>|</span>
  <br><br>
  In the above formulas, &epsilon; represents the estimated RTT, <i>s</i> represents the measured RTT, and &sigma; represents the deviation. &alpha; and &beta; are both unitless weighting factors (by convention, 0.125 and 0.25, respectively). There is an equivalence between &epsilon; and <i>s</i> here, as &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> must equal <i>s</i><sub>0</sub> as the basis of fucture iterations. A little algebra will yield an expansion of the previous first algorithm:
  <br><br>
  <span style="font-size: 18px">&epsilon;<sub>n</sub> = (1 - &alpha;)<sup>N</sup>s<sub>0</sub> + <span style="font-size: 30px">&Sigma;</span> (1 - &alpha;)<sup>n-1</sup>&alpha;s<sub>N-(n-1)</sub> + &alpha;s<sub>n</sub></span>
  <br><br>
  The final timeout interval is calculated through the following equation:<br><br>
  <span style="font-size: 18px">T = &epsilon;<sub>n</sub> + 4&sigma;<sub>n</sub><br><br></span>
  I could express this function in terms of the measured RTT as well, but frankly, I would rather not.
