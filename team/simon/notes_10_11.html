		<u>TCP - Timeout Calculation</u>
	</h2>
	<p>TCP is, at its heart, an rdt protocol, and so it has a set 'time-out' period after which it will retransmit the previous segment. The time chosen for this interval is not immediately obvious; it clearly must be greater than the expected round trip time of the segment, but how does TCP calculate this, and how long beyond this time should TCP idle? THere must be some compromise, as too little time may cause recurring retransmissions while confirmation is in transit, but too much time will stall transmission longer than necessary and reduce throughput.<br><br>
	TCP has a series of algorithms to achieve this compromise. The first is a weighted function utilized to calculate the estimated RTT, while the second calculates the average deviation of the RTT; the timeout duration is acquired through the repeated iteration of these functions.<br><br>
	These algorithms are as follows:<br><br>
	<u>RTT Algorithm</u><br>
	&epsilon;<sub>n</sub> = (1 - &alpha;)&epsilon;<sub>n-1</sub> + &alpha;s<sub>n</sub>
	<br><br>
	<u>Deviation Algorithm</u><br>
	&sigma;<sub>n</sub> = (1 - &beta;)&sigma;<sub>n-1</sub> + &beta;|s<sub>n</sub> - &epsilon;<sub>n</sub>|
	<br><br>
	In the above formulas, &epsilon; represents the estimated RTT, <i>s</i> represents the measured RTT, and &sigma; represents the deviation. &alpha; and &beta; are both unitless weighting factors (by convention, 0.125 and 0.25, respectively). There is an equivalence between &epsilon; and <i>s</i> here, as &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> must equal <i>s</i><sub>0</sub> as the basis of fucture iterations. A little algebra wil yield an expansion of the previous first algorithm:
	<br><br>
	&epsilon;<sub>n</sub> = (1 - &alpha;)<sup>N</sup>s<sub>0</sub> + &Sigma; (1 - &alpha;)<sup>n-1</sup>&alpha;s<sub>N-(n-1)</sub> + &alpha;s<sub>n</sub>
	<br><br>
	The final timeout interval is calculated through the following equation:<br><br>
	T = &epsilon;<sub>n</sub> + 4&sigma;<sub>n</sub><br><br>
	I could express this function in terms of the measured RTT as well, but frankly, I would rather not.
