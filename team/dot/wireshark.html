<h1>Wireshark Lab: HTTP 7.0</h1>
<h3>Changes from listed instructions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>I always restricted all captures to my computer's IP, to avoid cluttering the window with unnecessary information</li>
	<li>The school's internet is too fast for their 'long' page to be divided, so I used their sample capture for that problem</li>
</ol>
<h3>Lab</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Capture all HTTP packets when visiting <a href="http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file1.html">this site</a></li>
  <ul>
    <li><image src="./images/wireshark01.png" alt="Capture for Lab 1" style="width:1079;height:451;"></li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Both the server and client seem to be running HTTP 1.1</li>
    <li>Nothing seems to indicate that the server functions in any language other than English</li>
    <li>The server returned the status code '200 OK'</li>
    <li>The file was last modified a few seconds before I accessed it</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Cleare the cache and capture all HTTP packets when visiting <a href="http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file2.html">this site</a>, then immediately refresh the page</li>
  <ul>
    <li><image src="./images/wireshark02.png" alt="Capture for Lab 1" style="width:1074;height:615;"></li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>The second time the page was loaded, the browser recognized that it already had the most recent version of the page in its cache and didn't actually send the HTML data</li>
    <li>Because of this, the second request received a status code of '304 Not Modified'</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Capture all HTTP packets when visiting <a href="http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file3.html">this page</a></li>
  <ul>
    <li><image src="./images/wireshark03.png" alt="Capture for Lab 1" style="width:####;height:###;"></li><!--http-ethereal-trace-3-->
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>how many get messages were sent? which response packet contained the get message for the html page?</li>
    <li>which packet number contained the status code and phrase? what is the status code?</li>
    <li>how many data-contained segments were needed to carry the single response and text?</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Capture all HTTP packets when visiting <a href="http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file4.html">this page</a></li>
  <ul>
    <li><image src="./images/wireshark04.png" alt="Capture for Lab 1" style="width:####;height:###;"></li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>The browser sent 4 HTTP GET messages:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>GET the HTML page</li>
      <li>GET the first image</li>
      <li>GET the second image</li>
      <li>GET the second image</li>
    </ol>
    <li>The second image needed two messages because the first one returned that the image had been moved elsewhere</li>
    <li>The images seem to have been downloaded in serial, based on the timestamps on the response messages</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Capture all HTTP packets when visiting <a href="http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/protected_pages/HTTP-wireshark-file5.html">this page</a></li>
  <ul>
    <li><img src="./images/wireshark05.png" alt="Capture for Lab 1" style="width:;height:;"></li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>What is the server's response (status code and phrase) in response to the initial HTTP GET message from your browser?</li>
    <li>When the browser sends the second HTTP GET message, it has a new field: Authorization, containing the username and password</li>
  </ol>
