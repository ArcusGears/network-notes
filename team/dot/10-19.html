node: any device which runs a link-layer protocol
-hosts, routers, switches, wifi access points, etc

link: communication channel connecting adjacent nodes

transmitting node encapsulates datagram ina link-layer frame and sends frame into link

EX: travel agent planning a trip from new jersey to switzerland
-agent decides it's best to take a taxi to the jersey airport, a plane to the switzerland airport, and a train to the specific town in switzerland
-once reservations are made and tickets are bought, it is the various transport companies' jobs to get the traveller to the destination
-traveller = datagram, transportation companies = links, agent = routing protocol

possible link-layer protocol services:
-framing
--data field where datagram is inserted and some header fields
--structure specified by link-layer protocol
-link access
--Medium Access Control protocol specifies rules for transmitting frame onto link
--simplest for point-to-point links directly connection exactly two nodes
--more complicated when multiple nodes share one broadcast link (multiple access problem)
--coordinates frame transmissions of nodes
-reliable delivery
--guarantees to move each datagram across the link without error
--acheived similar to TCP, with ACKs and retransmissions
--often used for links with high error rates (like wifi)
--aims to correct error locally instead of forcing source to retransmit the whole thing
--unnecessary overhead for more reliable methods (fiber, coax, twisted-pair)
-error detection and correction
--bit errors introduced by attenuation and noise
--more sophisticated than checksum, implemented in hardware
--able to determine exactly where the error is and then fix it

link layer mostly implemented in a network adapter (aka Network Interface Card)
-heart of NIC, link-layer controller, a single special-purpose chip that implements many services
-most functionality in hardware
-originally separate cards, modern day integrated into motherboard (LAN-on-motherboard)

sending side, controller takes a datagram, encapsulates it in a link-layer frame and fills out header fields, and transmits into communication link as per link-access protocol
-possibly sets error detection bits

receiving side, controller receives frame, extracts datagram
-possibly checks for and corrects errors

server link software does high-level tasks like assembling addressing info and activating hardware

receiver link software handles interrupts, errors, and passing the extracted datagram up
