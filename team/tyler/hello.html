        Hi! I'm Tyler. I enjoy Tennis, Game Design, and Esports. In particular, I enjoy competitive Super Smash Bros.
        I look forward to meeting you all.
        
        Notes: October 4th 2016
        <u>Section1.6: Networks Under Attack</u>
        
        Malware: Data from the internet that infects hosts for malicious intent. Examples include spyware (collects private
        information, to send back to the origin of the spyware for their use), or deleting files from the host.
        
        Once infected with malware, hosts may inadvertently be enrolled in a botnet.
        Botnet: A network of hosts infected with malware, controlled by the malware distributor, to be used to further spread
        malware through spam email, or to perform a DoS attack against some host they have a bone to pick with.
        
        Most malware is Self Replicating: Can spread itself from one host to another, growing at a potentially exponential
        pace.
        
        Malware is spread in two ways, Viruses, and Worms.
        Viruses: Malware that requires the host's user to interact with it in some way. The text uses a very simple email
        spam example, where a user opens an attached document that runs malicious code of some sort, such as installing
        spyware.
        Worms: Malware that can enter a device without the host's user interaction. The text again provides an example.
        If you were to run a network application that was vulnerable to the worm, the application could accept this
        malware and install it without the user knowing it. Once in a host, worms scan other computers in the network, and
        attack any other hosts that are running the same vulnerable application.
        
        DoS attacks: an attack that renders a host, network, or infrastructure unusable by legitimate users.
        DoS attacks typically come in one of three flavors:Vulnerability Attacks, Bandwith Flooding, and Connection Flooding.
        The only type that the text goes into are Bandwithd Flooding, which is typically performed via
        DDoS attack. DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service attack. Essentially, the attackers uses 'slave' hosts
        from a botnet to send traffic to the target, until it cant handle the stress of the increased traffic.
        
        Packet Sniffers are programs that 'sniff' packets being sent through a network. Wireshark, which we used in class
        today, is a packet sniffer, for instance. People can place packet sniffers and attempt to aquire packets containing
        users personal information. Packet sniffers are hard to detect, since they don't actually add anything to the network,
        just read from it.
        
        IP Spoofing: Sending a packet with a fake source address. Basically, this would be like sending someone a letter with
        an address from one of their friends, so that they are more likely to open it. Though in this case that letter would
        containt malware. So for a real world example, if that letter contained nothing but exploding glitter. And then that
        glitter burned your house down.
        
        
        <u>October 5th Lab Notes (helpful Linux network commands)</u>
        Ping (ping ip_or_host_name): Sends an echo request to the given host or ip, then returns with the response and round
            trip time. IMPORTANT: To stop the ping, use Ctrl+C.
        Trace Route (traceroute machine_name_or_ip): Shows the route a packet takes to the given destination, by giving a
            series of hosts it travels through.
        Trace Path (tracepath machine_name_or_ip): Same as Trace Route, except it doesn't take 'complicated' options, whatever
            that means, I'm unsure.
        IfConfig (ifconfig): Lists all information on all network devices currently up.
        ifup (ifup devicename): Brings the chosen device up if currently down.
        ifdown (ifdown devicename): Brings the chosen device down if currently up.
        hostname (hostname): Tells you the hostname of the computer thats being used.

        <u>Transport Services Provided by the Internet</u>
        When you create a new network application for the internet, you have to choose between using TCP and UDP for a transport protocol.
        TCP
            TCP Provides two main services:
            Connection Oriented Service:Client and server exchange  transport control information before they begin exchanging messages.
                This is called the 'handshaking procedure'. After the 'handshake', a "TCP Connection" exists. Once the connection exists,
                the two processes can send messages to each other at the same time. After they finish, the connection must be 'torn down'.
            Reliable Data Transfer service:
            All data will be sent without error and in the proper order. No missing or duplicate bytes.
        UDP
            Connectionless
            Not reliable. Messages may arrive out of order or not at all.
            Less 'frilly'. Very lightweight transfer protocol.
        
        <u>October 10th Textbook Notes</u>
        The Transport-layer provide a <b>logical connection</b> between two applications. This means that the two applications can act
        as though they were directly connected, even if they actually have to go through dozens of steps to reach each other. I imagine
        this is critically important in things such as online videogames, or other such applications, where real time interaction is a 
        must. Transport layer protocols are implemented in the end systems, not the network routers. 
        <u> The Transport Layer of the Internet</u>
        The internet makes two transport-layer protocols available to the application layer, TCP and UDP.
        UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is unreliable, and connectionless.
        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is reliable, and connection-oriented.
        The application developer must choose between these two transport-layer protocols.
        
        As a brief aside, the Internet's network layer protocol is called <b>IP</b>. IP provides logical connections between hosts, but
        its a <b>best effort delivery service</b>. This means that it will try its best to deliver segments between hosts, but its
        ultimately unreliable. It doesn't guarentee that the segments are delivered, it doesn't guarentee they'll arrive in the same
        order that they were sent, and it doesn't guarentee the integrity of those segments. Every host has atleast one network-layer
        address, aka, an <b>IP Address</b>
        
        The most important function of TCP and UDP is <b> Transport layer multiplexing and demultiplexing</b>. Basically, this is
        extending the IP delivery service between two end systems, into a delivery service between two <i>applications</i> running on 
        those end systems.
        
        In addition, TCP and UDP also provide some of the integrity checking that IP doesn't, using error detection fields in their
        headers.
        
        As mentioned above, UDP is unreliable. These are the only functions UDP provides, and so it doesn't guarentee that data sent will
        be received. However, TCP provides several more services.
        
        Using techniques called flow control, sequence numbers, acknowledgements, and timers, TCP provides reliable data transfer. This
        is its biggest benefit over UDP by far.
        
        TCP also provides congestion control, which prevents any one connection from swamping routers and links with heavy traffic.
        It does this by basically capping the rate that a connection can send traffic into the network. However, UDP is unregulated, and
        so can send as much or as little traffic as it pleases.
