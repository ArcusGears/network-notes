Cyclic Redundancy Checks

    For today, I'm going to do something just a wee bit different. I found that the books explanation of CRC calculation pretty
confusing, so instead, I'm going to briefly go over how its calculated, in laymans terms.

    To begin, we are given two strings of binary of various length, G and D, and are further given a value for the length of r. Our goal
is to find 'r' through this CRC calculation so that we can determine exactly what bits were transmitted. So, to set-up the 
problem, we draw the Division Bracket (the symbol you use when you do long hand division like some kind of caveman. [I jest,
but I seriously don't think I've done long hand division since sixth grade...]) On the left side of the division bracket,
write 'G', each of its bits. Inside the division bracket, write each bit of 'D' out. Then, in addition, add a number of zeroes
to the end of 'D''s string equal to the length of 'r'.

    Now that were' set up, lets get into the nitty gritty. Begin by writing 'G' below 'D', lining up the bits starting from the
left hand side of 'D'
