    Q1. The World Wide Web was created between 1989 and 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee. In particular, Berners-Lee and his group developed
        early versions of four 'key components' of the web. What are those components? (Answer on page 64).
        
        A. HTML, HTTP, a Web Server, and a Browser.
    
    Q2. Almost every major internet application uses TCP over UDP, for a huge multitude of reasons. Many firewalls even block the majority
        of UDP traffic. However, Skype (and some other online application services) still prefers to use UDP over TCP, and will only use TCP
        if UDP communication fails. Given all of TCP's benefits, why would they ever choose to use UDP at all? (Answer on page 96)
        
        A. TCP suffers from header overheads. In addition, TCP has congestion control. While congestion control is great, Skype requires a
           minimal rate, and if congestion control forces it to be slower, that could seriously impact the applications useability. Since
           Skype calls can tolerate some loss, they would prefer using UDP instead of TCP in most cases.
           
    Q3. DNS is hierachical by design, but theoretically could work on just a single server. What are three of the four primary reasons
        a single server design isn't used? (Answers on pages 133 -134)
        
        A. Maintenance (one server would have to be updated every single time theres a new host), Single Point of Failure (if the server
           goes down, the whole internet goes down with it), Traffic Volume (this one single server would have to handle millions of users),
           and a Distant Centralized Database (Distance from the server means more users traveling through slow, congested links).
