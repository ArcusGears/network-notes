Wireless Links

    If we were to take a wired network and replace it with a wireless one, we'd have to make some minor changes to the link
layer, but no changes would be needed at the network layer (or any layer above that one). This is, of course, the entire point
of the layered design. Layers don't care how the other layers get their results, they only care that they get them so that
they can get do their own job and pass it on to the next layer.
    Important differences between a wired link, and a wireless link...
  1. Decreased Signal Strength: As most of us have almost certainly experienced (seriously, just try walking outside and
        browsing on Cornell's wifi.) wireless links have some signal strength issues. Because wireless links use
        electromagnetic radiation, the signal will naturally get worse as it passes through solid objects. Particularly walls.
        But, even in free space, the signals going to disperse in the air, and the farther you get from the sender, the worse
        its going to get. This is also known as Path Loss.
  
  2. Interference From Other Sources: Much like radiowaves running on the same frequency, wireless network devices running on
        the same frequency will have some interference issues. Not only that, but other objects that you might not expect can
        cause electromagnetic noise can cause interference to. This includes things like motors, or microwaves.
        
  3. Multipath Propagation: This occurs when portions of the electromagnetic wave reflect off things in the environment, or
        even the ground. This causes the signal to take different paths (and most likely of different lengths) when traveling
        between the sender and receiver. As such, the signal can become 'blurred'.
        
    So basically, a wired connection is almost always faster then a wireless one. Go buy lan adapters for your online gaming
needs, kids.

    The Signal to Noise ratio is a measure of the strength of a received wireless signal versus the 'noise' in the environment.
This ratio is measured in decibels. A larger ratio means a better signal. A better signal means a lower Bit Error Rate, that is,
the probability that any given trasmitted bit is an error when received. You can somewhat increase your signal to noise ratio
by increasing your transmission power, but it suffers from diminishing returns. There is only so much good that will do, and 
it can take a massive tole on the amount of energy used (cell phones drain faster, etc) and it interferes with everyone elses
signal. So yeah, that can prove to be a problem.
