		<h2>Reading Notes</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Network ongestions caused by too many sources sending data at too high a rate.</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Two hosts share single router with infinite buffer-->Delay increases.  Throughput ~= R/2.</li>
						<li>Two hosts share single router with finite buffer-->Increase in retransmitted packages.  May have unneeded retransmissions.  Throughput ~= R/3 if sender does not waste retransmissions, and ~= R/4 if retransmissions are wasted due to multipule forwards.</li>
						<li>Four hosts share four routers overlapping two-hop paths-->when a packet is dropped along a path, the transmission capacity that was used at each of the upstream links to forward that packet to the point at which it was dropped ends up having been wasted.</li>
					</ol>
				<li><b>Per-connection throughput</b>: number of bytes er second at the receiver.</li>
				<li><b>Offered load</b>: rate at which the transport layer sends segments into the network.</li>
