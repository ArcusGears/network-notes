				<li><b>Tyler</b>(4.2 virtual circuits)</li>
				<li>Network-layer services are host-to-host while transport layer is process-to-process</li>
				<li>In computer network architecture is either host-to-host connection or host-to-host connectionless.  Networks that provide only connections are virtual circuit networks.</li>
				<li>Virtual circuit is a path between source and destination host, VS numbers (one for each link along the path), and entries in a forwarding table in each router.</li>
				<li>Packets have VC numbers in header, when they got though a link the router replaces the VC number with a new VC number.</li>
				<li>Each router has a forwarding table where VC numbers are stored.</li>
				<li>Eliminates need for communication between routers</li>
				<li>Routers must maintain connection state information, so they must update forwarding table</li>
				<li><b>Salem</b>(4.1 switches)</li>
				<li>Router forwarding--refers to the router-local action of transferring a packet from input link interface to appropritate output link interface.</li>
				<li>Switching via memory: Takes imput, stores in memeory, finds matching output, sends it though.  Only one at a time.</li>
				<li>Switching via bus: Has an imput pre-pend (assigned spot), enters bus, transferred, sends though to destination.  One at a time.</li>
				<li>Switching via interconnected network: netowrk consisting of 2N bueses that connect N imput ports to N output.  Each vertical bus intersects each horizontal at cross point.  Opened or closed at any time.  Can send multipule if the route is clear (?)</li>
				<li>Output processing: takes packets that have been stored in the output port's memory nad transmits them over the output link.</li>
				<li>Routing processor: maintains routing tables and attached link state information and computes the forwarding table for the router.</li>
				<li>Head of line: Have to wait for packets in front to be sent, before later packets can be sent to their destination. (Red and blue example Jeremy did).</li>
